# resource-game
A 2D Open World (RPG/Life/Tycoon) concept game

In my aspiration to create a game that will allow players to gather many different resources, use any of them however they like, wether it be building, refining, crafting, forging,
the goal is to eventually evolve from a lowly savage living in a small tent in the woods, to the king of the galaxy. You start off on a planet in a forest a couple of miles away from a city, one of several visitable citys on the planet.
From here you will progress toward citys and other areas where you can purchase new houses, transportation, appearal, furniture, and tools.

While trying to create this world, I'll be trying to devise many different ways to program the game so I can learn as much as I can about core programming concepts and what not.

More ideas to come? This is my first project so please excuse me if this readme isn't what you'd normally expect, it's more for myself at the moment than for anyone else.
